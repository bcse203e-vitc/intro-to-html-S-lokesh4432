            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first paragraph. It is indented using the non-breaking space command (&amp;nbsp;). The text appears indented to simulate the effect of a paragraph indentation.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second paragraph. It also uses the &amp;nbsp; command to create the same indentation effect as the first paragraph.
